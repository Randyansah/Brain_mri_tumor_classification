## BRAIN TUMOR CLASSIFICATION

## INTRODUCTION
### What Is A Tumor
A tumor is a solid mass of tissue that forms when abnormal cells group together. Tumors can affect bones, skin, tissue, organs and glands. Many tumors are not cancer (they’re benign). But they still may need treatment. Cancerous, or malignant, tumors can be life-threatening and require cancer treatment.
A tumor is a mass or group of abnormal cells that form in the body. If you have a tumor, it isn’t necessarily cancer. Many tumors are benign (not cancerous).

Tumors can form throughout the body. They can affect bone, skin, tissues, glands and organs. Neoplasm is another word for tumor.

### MRI
Magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, is a noninvasive medical imaging test that produces detailed images of almost every internal structure in the human body, including the organs, bones, muscles and blood vessels. MRI scanners create images of the body using a large magnet and radio waves.

### TYPES OF BRAIN TUMOR IN THIS PROJECT
    GLIOMA:Glioma is a common type of tumor originating in the brain. About 33 percent of all brain tumors are gliomas, which originate in the glial cells that surround and support neurons in the brain, including astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and ependymal cells.

    MENINGIOMA:Meningioma is the most common type of primary brain tumor, accounting for approximately 30 percent of all brain tumors.
    These tumors originate in the meninges, which are the outer three layers of tissue between the skull and the brain that cover and protect the brain just under the skull.
    Meningiomas grow out of the middle layer of the meninges called the arachnoid. They grow slowly and may exist for years before being detected. Sometimes doctors will discover a meningioma incidentally on a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the head or spinal cord.

    PITUITARY:Pituitary tumors are unusual growths that develop in the pituitary gland. This gland is an organ about the size of a pea. It's located behind the nose at the base of the brain. Some of these tumors cause the pituitary gland to make too much of certain hormones that control important body functions.
